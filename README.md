# Indeed Job Listings: Data Cleaning and Transformation
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on the cleaning and transformation of Data Science job listings scraped from Indeed. The project aims to prepare this data for further analysis by:

* __Cleaning Key Columns__: Implementing Python and Regex techniques to clean essential columns like 'Job_Title,' 'Job_Location,' 'Salary_Range,' and 'Job_Type.'

* __Categorizing Data__: Utilizing NLP to categorize job listings based on domain and seniority, making the dataset easier to analyze.

* __Skill Extraction__: Implementing Regex techniques to comb through the job descriptions and identify the data science-related skills requirement.

* __Enriching with Geolocation Data__: Using Geopy to fetch geographic coordinates of job locations and visualizing them with Folium, adding a geospatial dimension to the dataset.

The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand how to clean and transform complex, real-world data into a more usable format.
