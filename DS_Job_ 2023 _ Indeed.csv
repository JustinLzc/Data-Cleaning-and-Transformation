 Academic Development Programme - new Assistant Professors will undertake a 5-year development programme, at the end of which they are expected to be promoted to Associate Professor. The programme consists of a variety of development opportunities and the time to reflect and develop. 
 Background 
 The School of Government at the University of Birmingham welcomes applications at Assistant Professor level from candidates with academic interests at the intersection of transformative technologies, innovation, and global affairs. 
 We are seeking to appoint exceptional candidates to contribute to the Data Science Initiative in the College of Social Sciences, which aims to expand research and practice focused on transformative technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) and data science in the social sciences. This forms part of a sustained and increasing programme of investment in data science and AI research at the University of Birmingham. As our Data Science Initiative expands, we aim to build up our position in the global ecosystem where cutting-edge technology perspectives interface with society, businesses, and government issues. 
 Transformative technologies bear immense potential to solve global problems, but they also pose new unforeseen risks. Recent advancements in AI have the potential to fundamentally transform the public and private sector, including personal and collective spheres. This technological leap requires well-thought-out approaches, policies, regulations, and other responses, both domestically and internationally. It calls on academic, industry and governmental partners to develop responsible technologies that deliver for the good of humanity. 
 To this end, we are creating an academic position with a significant focus on government and business engagement, and domestic and international partnerships. An Assistant Professor appointment in this role would act as a bridge between academia, industry, and government - three sectors that frequently operate in separate silos but stand to gain significantly from increased collaboration. They would expedite knowledge transfer, promote the application of our research, and cultivate an understanding of how AI can be harnessed to address national and global challenges. 
 We invite applications from candidates with expertise in AI, innovation, and global affairs. We are particularly interested in candidates with a senior level experience in business, government, or international organisations and multilateral processes. Successful candidates will be based in the School of Government but will collaborate closely with the School of Computer Science through the Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IIDSAI). We expect successful candidates to be passionate about interdisciplinary research and teaching. 
 We particularly welcome applications from female, black and minority ethnic candidates who are underrepresented in the school. We are happy to discuss flexible working.

 Background 
 The School of Government at the University of Birmingham welcomes applications at Associate Professor level from candidates with academic interests at the intersection of transformative technologies, innovation, and global affairs. 
 We are seeking to appoint exceptional candidates to contribute to the Data Science Initiative in the College of Social Sciences, which aims to expand research and practice focused on transformative technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) and data science in the social sciences. This forms part of a sustained and increasing programme of investment in data science and AI research at the University of Birmingham. As our Data Science Initiative expands, we aim to build up our position in the global ecosystem where cutting-edge technology perspectives interface with society, businesses, and government issues. 
 Transformative technologies bear immense potential to solve global problems, but they also pose new unforeseen risks. Recent advancements in AI have the potential to fundamentally transform the public and private sector, including personal and collective spheres. This technological leap requires well-thought-out approaches, policies, regulations, and other responses, both domestically and internationally. It calls on academic, industry and governmental partners to develop responsible technologies that deliver for the good of humanity. 
 To this end, we are creating an academic position with a significant focus on government and business engagement, and domestic and international partnerships. An Associate Professor appointment in this role would act as a bridge between academia, industry, and government - three sectors that frequently operate in separate silos but stand to gain significantly from increased collaboration. They would expedite knowledge transfer, promote the application of our research, and cultivate an understanding of how AI can be harnessed to address national and global challenges. 
 We invite applications from candidates with expertise in AI, innovation, and global affairs. We are particularly interested in candidates with a senior level experience in business, government, or international organisations and multilateral processes.

    Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics
    Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) is one of the largest academic astronomy research groups in Europe, studying a very broad range of astrophysical research, in particular Cosmology, Galaxy formation and evolution, AGN and Star-formation, Galactic Astronomy, Time-domain astrophysics (including Pulsars, Masers and Exoplanets) and Solar Physics. Research staff are located in the Alan Turing Building on the main Manchester campus, and comprises around 30 academic staff, 50 postdoctoral researchers, and 60 post-graduate students. The Group publishes in excess of 400 refereed papers per year with many appearing in the highest impact journals. Academic staff are involved in many international collaborations with colleagues in Europe and North America but increasingly involves developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. JBCA operates the 76-metre Lovell Telescope, and the UK’s National Radio Astronomy Facility, e-MERLIN/VLBI, and host’s the UK’s ALMA Regional Centre Node. JBCA’s telescope facilities are located at Jodrell Bank Observatory, which also hosts the Headquarters of the SKAO. JBCA and SKA staff have close links, with several SKA staff enjoying honorary university appointments. Several large compute facilities are operated by the group both on campus and at the observatory.
    The SKAO and SKA Regional Centres
    The SKA will be the largest and therefore the most sensitive radio telescope ever built and will play a major role in answering key questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology (see www.skatelescope.org). It will be one of a small number of cornerstone observatories observing the electromagnetic spectrum that will transform our view of the Universe. The SKA Observatory (SKAO) comprises two telescope facilities; one located in South Africa, SKA-MID, to observe mid-band frequencies between 350MHz and 15.4GHz, and one located in Australia, SKA-LOW, to observe lower band frequencies between 50MHz and 350MHz. The SKAO’s Global Headquarters, is hosted at The University of Manchester’s Jodrell Bank Observatory.
    In order to process and analyse the vast amounts of data produced by the SKAO, there is now an international effort to design and prototype SKA Regional Centres (SRCs) in which astronomers will be able to interact with the data. The network of SRCs will provide infrastructure, services and expert support that will enable a global capability to distribute, process, analyse and curate the data from the telescopes.
    The UK’s Square Kilometre Array Regional Centre project (UKSRC, 8 partners, £7.2M operations plus £6M capital and development 2023-2025), will work with an international network to develop infrastructure that will enable astronomers to transform our understanding of the universe, and provide the main interface for UK astronomers to access SKAO data and extract science from the SKAO. The UKSRC will provide e-infrastructure resources, services, and end-to-end expert science support and training to exploit the SKAO and SKA pathfinder and precursor data and science.
    Together with colleagues at Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, RAL and UCL, The University of Manchester are co-developing a UKSRC facility. The UKSRC will be working within the SRCNet and contributing to the international SRCNet design programme. Areas of work include: data logistics; cloud computing; stewardship, archiving and data stack; science analysis platform; science support; training and outreach.
    The University of Manchester’s JBCA and Computer Science department form a major component of the new UKSRC facility. These advertised posts are part of a major recruitment process including 12 new appointments across research and technical development domains which will joining the existing team. The Manchester-UKSRC team will have the opportunity to be based across both the JBO in Cheshire, adjacent to the SKAO global Headquarters and JBCA in the University of Manchester central campus. UKSRC staff will be able to located at both sites providing a mixture of working environments embedded within a vibrant and stimulating research and operations groups. The Manchester-UKSRC will also work closely with e-MERLIN/VLBI National Radio Astronomy Facility, providing local access to SKA pathfinder data streams, the UK’s ALMA Regional Centre Node, and JBCA’s radio astronomy expertise, including world-leading groups working in Pulsar and time-domain astronomy, through to radio cosmology.
    The UKSRC is a strategic priority for JBCA and STFC, and the SRCNet (and UKSRC) is being developed with the expectation of a multi-decade operational phase. Further extensions beyond this initial grant period are expected for successful candidates in these roles.

Part of the Science, Technology, Analysis and Research group led by the Chief Scientific Advisor, it delivers high quality analysis and insight across the department, providing objective support to senior leaders, enabling the department to understand and tackle complex problems, increase operational effectiveness and develop organisational strategy.
      Once in post, successful candidates who are not existing badged members of either Government Statistical Group (GSG) or Government Operational Research Service (GORS) will have the opportunity to apply for membership of the relevant profession subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements.
      Recruitment and retention allowance (RRA): Successful candidates with exceptional skills and experience may apply for a Recruitment Retention Allowance up to a maximum of £9,950. This allowance is subject to an initial review within six months of taking up the post and thereafter an annual review in line with departmental priorities and could be reduced or withdrawn at any time.
      Hybrid Working: These roles are suitable for hybrid working. Hybrid working enables employees to work partly in their workplace and partly at home. These posts can be based at either Croydon or London and, in line with current HO Hybrid Working policy, there will be flexibility to adopt a hybrid working pattern which would see the post holder spend 40% of their week in the office, with the remainder working from home.
      We are currently advertising for Principal Data Scientists posts in:
     
       National Crime & Justice Lab
     
      The National Crime and Justice Lab (NCJL) is an exciting programme of work which intends to fulfil the 2019 Manifesto Commitment to create a ‘world class crime laboratory’. The lab will enable researchers to access sensitive police and wider Criminal Justice System (CJS) datasets and deliver insights with real-world impact into priority CJS strategic and operational policing issues.
      The Principal Data Scientist will be instrumental in the development of the NCJL data science strategy, working closely with counterparts in the HO Analytics and Insights community. They will oversee and assure the approach on the design and delivery of data matching and linking projects, as well as the development of research use cases for the lab. 
     You will be responsible for inspiring Data Science best practice and be a recognised authority on data science specialisms within the programme, and you will have exposure and direct engagement with senior technical and non-technical stakeholders across Home Office, Policing and wider Criminal Justice agencies.
     
       Data Science Insights Team
     
      As a Principal Data Scientist in the Data Science Insights Team you will inspire best practice and be a recognised authority on a number of data science specialisms within government, with the ability to understand, teach and supervise a wide range of cutting-edge analysis techniques. 
     You will provide oversight of projects of high political exposure, value or complexity, and engage with senior stakeholders to champion the value of data science. As an experienced practitioner you’ll be hands-on with delivery, with the expectation that you’ll spend up to half of your time utilising your expertise and providing technical leadership in the process. You will also be a thought leader within the Data Science community and manage the development of junior staff.
      The ethics of data analytics are rightly subject to a high degree of public scrutiny and expert debate, especially in relation to the Home Office sector. The Home Office aims to lead the way in ethical analytics and help establish cross-Government best practice.
    
   
   
     Job description
    
      Post 1: National Crime & Justice Lab
      The National Crime and Justice Lab (NCJL) Programme sits within the Public Safety Group that is responsible for coordinating and delivering the Government’s approach to preventing crime. To deliver this we take an evidence-based approach, working with partners at national and local levels, and tackling the drivers of crime: opportunity, profit, character, the effectiveness of the Criminal Justice System, alcohol and drugs.
      Across Policing and the Home Office there are critical questions that need answering to improve Criminal Justice outcomes. The data exists to answer many of these questions, but it is hidden within large sensitive datasets that need cleaning, linking, and analysing. To date, this has been constrained by both limited understanding of the data, and access to the data.
      The data landscape in which the NCJL operates is complex. There is overwhelming agreement that making better use of Police and CJS data, through linked data, is highly desirable. However, the sensitive nature of Police data makes accessing and working with these data sets challenging. Whilst the initial focus is on Police and CJS data, there is potential for the lab to widen its scope towards wider administrative data used in Government.
      You will be joining the NCJL programme as the Principal Data Scientist and will be responsible for defining the direction, approaches, and strategies for the data science components of the lab including data linking (deterministic/probabilistic) and analysis. As part of this role, you will be coordinating with other Home Office units to develop repeatable policies and processes that align with wider HO data science standards.
      Also reporting into HOAI, you’ll also be part of a like-minded community of data and analytical professionals who work across Home Office subject domains.
      You will be involved, oversee, and provide strategic direction on various functions of programme delivery. You will be required to understand the potential of the selected datasets and develop an approach to fully harness the data whilst defining the processing and analytical viability, working with Home Office and wider CJ stakeholders. You will be able to set direction and provide specialist knowledge on methodologies and approaches, and the art of the possible, guiding internal NCJL data scientists on best-practice. You will support the successful delivery of data analysis and be able to understand and critique complex statistical modelling to ensure that the NCJL can produce high-quality outputs that meet the business needs. You will also be the main point of contact with the service that provides access to the platform where the data is held, ensuring that analyst and data scientist requirements are clearly communicated to the service and implemented by them to a satisfactory standard.
      Please note for this post you will be required to undertake and successfully obtain Non-Police Personnel Vetting level 3 (NPPV3) once in post.
      The Principal Data Scientist for the NCJL post will involve:
     
       Responsibility for defining the data science strategy across the programme, ensuring coordination and alignment with Home Office data science standards, and supporting the adoption of best practice and Home Office Analytical Quality Assurance processes across the range of data science activities underpinning the lab.
       You will become the expert in the selected datasets overtime, understanding how the data can be used to address specific political or strategic Policing and policy problems. Based on your expert understanding, you will support the development of feasibility assessments for use of datasets, identifying early assumptions of the practical use of the data.
       You will be responsible for the design and development of the analytics projects (referred to as ‘use cases’). You will build an excellent understanding of the technical landscape in which the programme operates. You will be responsible for defining the appropriate methodologies, models and techniques that should be used and produce this as an output that can be shared with internal and external stakeholders.
       As part of the Strategic-level Core Lab Team, you will have a leadership role for data scientists across the data processing and analysis functions. You will define the resource and technical requirements for each analytics project and have a shared responsibility for ensuring that the resource operates in an environment where they can work effectively, providing effective mentorship and coaching where needed.
       You will build networks with Data Science experts in Home Office and other government departments (such as the Government Digital Service, the Ministry of Justice and the Office for National Statistics), academia (such as the Alan Turing Institute) and the private sector, keeping in touch with developments in this fast-moving field to ensure that the NCJL is at the forefront of innovation, best practice and impact.
     
      Post 2: Data Science Insights Team
      The Data Science Insights Team is a cross-cutting function at the centre of HOAI, created to champion the use of data and new techniques to better inform the department’s policy and strategic decision making, and to foster a step change in the department’s data capability by democratising the use of data science techniques. As a central team we work with the wider analytical directorate to deliver data science projects across the department’s remit – from migration and borders to crime and policing, to homeland security – so you can expect to be working on some of the most challenging, high-profile problems in Government, across all areas of the Home Office’s responsibilities.
      As a Principal Data Scientist, you’ll act as a data science ambassador and lead engagement to stimulate imaginations and interest, generating new project commissions as you do so, and subsequently overseeing successful delivery. You’ll have a good knowledge across the range of data science techniques, but along with your counterparts in the wider unit you will also have (or develop) specialist knowledge in a given domain of data science, enabling you to act as the in-house expert in that area and provide technical consultancy where needed to other projects in the directorate.
      You’ll take responsibility for delivery of commissions, managing a project team, working with unique datasets and advanced analytical techniques, using Agile to ensure rapid delivery of value for customers and failing-fast as appropriate, and ensuring work is robust and performed to a high-standard utilising the department’s Analytical Quality Assurance processes. You’ll also get hands-on, with the expectation that you’ll spend up to half of your time utilising your data science expertise in delivery – providing technical leadership as needed in the process. You will be highly skilled in producing high quality outputs and communicating them in a way that has real impact.
      The Principal Data Scientist in Data Science Insights Team post will involve:
     
       Responsibility for engaging with teams across the analytical directorate, building a network of key stakeholders, developing understanding of the domains they support, and working with them to identify and guide opportunities for commissions. As you do so you’ll act as a data science leader and ambassador for your team, sharing knowledge and providing technical consultation, and helping build our profile in the directorate.
       You’ll support project delivery, overseeing and providing technical leadership to your team, as well as getting hands-on and utilising your own expertise. You’ll ensure effective use of Agile to deliver iteratively, and that outputs are always delivered to a high standard. From time to time you’ll also oversee response to urgent ad-hoc requests for analysis as needed, ensuring quality and timely responses to the business.
       As part of Senior Management, you’ll have a leadership role for data scientists across the team and will have a shared responsibility for ensuring that the team is a great place for data scientists to work. You’ll have direct line management responsibility for up to 1-2 senior and/or junior data scientists and provide mentorship and coaching, taking a key role in supporting their development.
       You will take responsibility for the quality and impact of work completed by your project teams, will ensure that effective Quality Assurance processes are embedded, and lead / support engagement with senior customers and partners to ensure the effective delivery and implementation of these projects.
       You will build networks with Data Science experts in other government departments (such as the Government Digital Service and the Office for National Statistics), academia (such as the Alan Turing Institute) and the private sector, keeping in touch with developments in this fast-moving field to ensure that Home Office remains at the forefront of innovation, best practice and impact.

 Background 
 The Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG) at the University of Birmingham invites applications for a Research Fellow with a strong background in Natural Language Processing. This is a 3-year position. 
 This position is an excellent opportunity for a highly motivated and skilled researcher to play a pivotal role in the Centre's mission to expand the role of AI and data science in the social sciences. This mission is institutionally supported through the Data Science Initiative in the College of Social Sciences. The Centre is based within the Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IIDSAI), which is a nexus for collaborative research and education at the University of Birmingham. Working across all five Colleges, the Institute is developing and fostering a culture of continuous interaction to address important challenges in areas including governance, sustainability, equality, health, and data-driven science. 
 Role Summary 
 The Fellow is expected to primarily contribute to the Centre’s research area in understanding and modelling causal relationships in natural language. Understanding causal language is crucial for advancing the fields of NLP and AI more broadly, as it allows for more accurate and nuanced interpretation of human communication. By identifying and modelling the causal relationships present in language, NLP and AI systems can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and meaning in texts, enabling more accurate predictions, inference, and decision-making. This is particularly important when dealing with complex, real-world problems, where causality plays a key role in shaping events and outcomes. Furthermore, improved understanding of causal language can enhance the explainability and transparency of AI systems, as it can reveal the rationale behind their predictions and recommendations. This, in turn, can help build trust in AI systems, facilitating their adoption across various domains and fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. Overall, understanding causal language is essential for unlocking the full potential of NLP and AI technologies, enabling them to better comprehend and interact with the intricate and causally-driven world in which we live. 
 Beyond foundational NLP research, the Centre is also interested in developing applications of causal language models. For example, attribution of credit and blame in political communication, public policy and financial markets analysis, legal reasoning, and misinformation and disinformation detection. 
 The Fellow can also be involved in the Centre’s two additional core active research areas around the role of generative AI in the information environment for effective accountability and representation in democratic political systems; and methods to track public and government engagement with the health effects of climate change.

 Background 
 The Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG) at the University of Birmingham invites applications for a Research Fellow with a strong background in Natural Language Processing. This is a 3-year position. 
 This position is an excellent opportunity for a highly motivated and skilled researcher to play a pivotal role in the Centre's mission to expand the role of AI and data science in the social sciences. This mission is institutionally supported through the Data Science Initiative in the College of Social Sciences. The Centre is based within the Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IIDSAI), which is a nexus for collaborative research and education at the University of Birmingham. Working across all five Colleges, the Institute is developing and fostering a culture of continuous interaction to address important challenges in areas including governance, sustainability, equality, health, and data-driven science. 
 Role Summary 
 The Fellow is expected to primarily contribute to the Centre’s research area in understanding and modelling causal relationships in natural language. Understanding causal language is crucial for advancing the fields of NLP and AI more broadly, as it allows for more accurate and nuanced interpretation of human communication. By identifying and modelling the causal relationships present in language, NLP and AI systems can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and meaning in texts, enabling more accurate predictions, inference, and decision-making. This is particularly important when dealing with complex, real-world problems, where causality plays a key role in shaping events and outcomes. Furthermore, improved understanding of causal language can enhance the explainability and transparency of AI systems, as it can reveal the rationale behind their predictions and recommendations. This, in turn, can help build trust in AI systems, facilitating their adoption across various domains and fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. Overall, understanding causal language is essential for unlocking the full potential of NLP and AI technologies, enabling them to better comprehend and interact with the intricate and causally-driven world in which we live. 
 Beyond foundational NLP research, the Centre is also interested in developing applications of causal language models. For example, attribution of credit and blame in political communication, public policy and financial markets analysis, legal reasoning, and misinformation and disinformation detection. 
 The Fellow can also be involved in the Centre’s two additional core active research areas around the role of generative AI in the information environment for effective accountability and representation in democratic political systems; and methods to track public and government engagement with the health effects of climate change. 
 Main Duties 
 
  Conduct innovative research on causal language analysis, contributing to the advancement of state-of-the-art methods and tools. 
  Develop novel methodologies and techniques for detection and analysis of causal relationships in text data. 
  Pursue personal research including developing research ideas and winning support, including financial support. 
  Plan, publish and execute high quality research. 
  Project manage research activities and supervise other research staff. 
  Present findings in high quality publications and conference proceedings. 
  Supervise and examine PhD students, both within and out with the University. 
  Provide expert advice to colleagues and students within discipline. 
  Contribute to the administration/management of research in the Centre. 
  Develop and make substantial contributions to knowledge transfer, enterprise, business engagement and public engagement activities of manifest benefit to the Centre and the University. 
  Contribute to some administrative activities within the University, typically relating to research. 
  Apply knowledge in a way that develops new intellectual understanding. 
  Actively manage equality, diversity and inclusion through monitoring and evaluation and actively challenging unacceptable behaviour. 
 
 Person Specification 
 
  PhD in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics, or a related field. 
  Extensive research experience and scholarship in natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. 
  Extensive experience of applying and/or developing and devising successful models, techniques and methods. 
  Extensive experience in advanced statistical methods and data visualisation techniques. 
  Extensive experience and demonstrated success in planning, undertaking and project managing research to deliver high quality results. 
  Extensive experience and achievement in knowledge transfer, enterprise and similar activity. 
  Experience and achievement reflected in a growing reputation. 
  Experience of championing Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in own work area. 
  Ability to monitor and evaluate the extent to which equality and diversity legislation, policies, procedures are applied. 
 Ability to identify issues with the potential to impact on protected groups and take appropriate action.

 The School of Informatics and Digital Engineering is part of the School of Engineering and Physical Sciences. As a cohesive and cross-disciplinary School, we focus on real-world skills and research, via teaching that delivers industry-ready graduates, and research that brings impact. Aston’s Mathematics Department has an important role in this work, as mathematical skills are increasingly an integral part of our everyday and digital lives, via an understanding of the theories and applications that make sense of the world around us – from computer modelling and data analysis in, for example, transport networks to the stock market, and health services to climate change. 
  In this environment our Mathematics Department has a strong applied mathematics undergraduate degree designed with a placement year, as well as a large cohort of postgraduate MSc Data Analytics students. We are actively engaged in research which underpins and develops the work across our School, College and the rest of the University, and which makes a difference to a range of beneficiaries. We are particularly keen, therefore, to receive applications from academics who are excited by our balanced mission of excellence in both research and teaching, and have a high quality research and teaching profile in Machine Learning. 
  An ability to contribute to the teaching and research of Mathematical Machine Learning is essential. You will have a track record of, or the potential for, excellent teaching (appropriate to career stage), and a clearly developed research plan for the future, and good collaborations. You must also be committed to excellent teaching and outstanding student support. A PhD in a subject allied to Mathematics is essential, as is relevant professional and/or academic experience. If you have experience of leading postgraduate programmes that would be an advantage.

The Environment Science and Analysis (ESA) division’s Spatial Data Science (SDS) unit is at the forefront of this work, developing novel data sources and utilising new tools and techniques to support departmental priorities.
      This role is in the core Spatial Data Science unit, and as a team, our work feeds into some critical policy areas, for example the development of new Environmental Land Management schemes and the implications of new policy on land use. Working across policy teams, our work is often fast-paced, and provides an opportunity to work with a range of teams, looking for opportunities to improve the impact of our analysis. We also work to champion the use of geography and spatial data science across government, promoting good practice and developing innovative ways of working with large and complex spatial data.
      This role will contribute by developing and championing innovative approaches to the development of analysis, data models, products and solutions. A key function will be exploring how newer technologies and ways of working might help the department draw and communicate robust and reproducible insight from large datasets.

       Developing and improving big data infrastructure and analytics within the team e.g. the spatial data science data model
       Exploiting new and novel data sources, including administrative data, Earth observations, and social media, to generate new insight on subjects such as environmental change, people's engagement with the environment, and rural socio-economic deprivation
       Exploring new and novel tools and techniques to support scalable and effective spatial data science
       Working with policy, delivery, and natural science stakeholders across Defra group and beyond government to design and deliver evidence that supports business outcomes
     
      The successful candidate will have the support of a senior data engineer and senior data scientist who will help develop their skills. They will be expected to work on a diverse and challenging set of projects from across the team including land use modelling for priorities such as Net Zero, modelling to support environmental outcomes from the Department's new Environment Land Management Scheme, and analysis of rural and environmental statistics. There may also be opportunities to get involved in wider work of the division depending on experience and priorities.
      We would like to hear from you if you have the following essential experience:
     
       Data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation, including experience of working with various types of data
       Technical experience using Python/R including experience of improving the quality and reusability of code using version control (e.g. Git), package development, and automated tests and checks

Prior experience on the application domains is a plus but not required.
    The team is funded by an UKRI Turing AI World-Leading Fellowship and hosted in the recently established Centre for AI Fundamentals, which is cross-Faculty initiative with significant internal investment, forming a core of an ambitious plan to establish Manchester as an internationally leading centre for AI research and innovation.
    You will have excellent opportunities for working with top-notch collaborators on use cases in application fields in the University of Manchester, machine learning collaborators at the Turing Institute and ELLIS, and with industry in both the centre and the newly established Manchester Turing Innovation Hub.
    The University actively fosters a culture of inclusion and diversity and seeks to achieve true equality of opportunity for all members of its community. The Faculty welcomes applications from all sections of the community and are committed to having a representative workforce. Across our Schools/Departments, we hold Bronze and Silver Athena SWAN Awards, which recognise our commitment to equality, diversity, inclusion and access and particularly the advancement of women’s careers in STEM. 
   The University also holds a Bronze Race Charter Mark recognising our commitment to improving the representation, progression and success of minority ethnic staff and students within higher education. In addition, we are a Disability Confident Employer, guaranteeing an interview for any disabled applicant who meets the essential criteria for a job. 
   What you will get in return:

     Excellent employee health and wellbeing services including an Employee Assistance Programme
     Exceptional starting annual leave entitlement, plus bank holidays
     Additional paid closure over the Christmas period

 At Seatfrog, we're shaking up the rail industry with our innovative platform, changing the game for rail operators and passengers alike. We were the first to market with our solution which enables rail operators to sell unsold first-class seat; generating ancillary revenue and providing passengers with incredible upgrade deals. 
 We've come a long way since then. We’ve revolutionised the way people can travel by rail; expanded our platform allowing passengers to buy train tickets, and swap their trains at the last minute all at the click of a few buttons. But we're not done yet - we have more exciting products on the way that will transform the way people experience rail travel.

As well as being data driven, you’ll have a knack for communicating across a wide range of stakeholders, some of whom will be non-technical; so not only will you be used to making complex concepts accessible, you’ll also help clients figure out what they really need when they’re not quite sure themselves.

 Applications are invited for a Research Associate position within a project that strives to develop new methodologies to address the current gaps in our knowledge and lead to establishing a tool that will assess diet-induced non-communicable disease (NCD) risk. The project is funded by EU HORIZON and UKRI and titled ""CoDiet: Combating diet related non-communicable disease through enhanced surveillance"" and involves 17 partners from 10 countries. Work package (WP) 1 concerns the development of AI driven literature searching tools to bring clear understanding of the large global literature of the physiological and metabolic links between diet and NCD. This WP is lead by academic investigators from Imperial College London (Dr Joram Posma, Dr Marek Rei, Prof Gary Frost) and the University of Leicester (Dr Tim Beck), and involves multiple EU partners. 
  This position involves developing relation extraction (RE) (between phenotypes, genotypes and other biomedical entities within sentences and table data) and question-answering (QA) (extracting the relevant text based on a research question) algorithms. 
 Duties and responsibilities 
 You will be responsible to apply existing RE algorithms to link different annotated biomedical entities/key terms and fine-tune the algorithms using feedback from a team of expert annotators within the CoDiet consortium. These fine-tuned algorithms will then be deployed on the remaining literature (we estimate this to be >20,000 relevant articles) in fully automated fashion. For compute, you will have access to dedicated GPU resources in the Department of Computing. The combination of the separate algorithm outputs will enable articles to be summarised and their relevance judged based on the search query, thereby enabling CoDiet to review and summarise a much larger portion of the literature than would be possible using current manual methods. The goal of CoDiet is to review the full available literature using the initial search terms to provide the most comprehensive overview of relationships between diet, NCDs and physiological processes to help other WPs prioritise their analytical and data science tools. Together with another PDRA, you will create a live, interactive graph that summarises the literature and connections between entities that will facilitate the knowledge transfer, and write papers to disseminate the work to a wider audience. For the entire set of literature documents you will develop QA capable methods to be deployed on the graph and underlying literature data to effectively summarise the data. 
  The role will require regular contributions to a variety of normal academic tasks, including management of research projects, positively interacting and communicating with internal and external partners, developing research proposals, supervision of Master and PhD students, and demonstrating research excellence and leadership to more junior members of the Research Group. You will lead on the relation extraction and question-answering aspects, and collaborate with two other postdocs working within WP1 and with CoDiet staff from partners in Spain, Ireland and Greece. You will receive strong mentoring in a stimulating multidisciplinary academic research environment, with access to internationally leading academics, industrial partners, research computing facilities, and networks. 
 Essential requirements
  
 
  
  Hold a PhD in computer science, biostatistics or a closely related field, or equivalent research, industrial or commercial experience 
   Experience with implementing NLP applications in Python 
   Basic understanding of biological and medical terminology 
   Productive track record of publishing high-quality papers in peer-reviewed journals, or in conference proceedings 
   Well organised, attention to detail, critical thinking, and ability to work as part of a team
 
  
 
 Further information 
 This is a fixed term post for 18 months, for an anticipated start date in September 2023. Later (and earlier) start dates in 2023 are also possible, depending on the circumstances of the candidate. 
 
  Candidates who have not yet been officially awarded their PhD will be appointed as a Research Assistant within the salary range £40,694 - £43,888 per annum.

  Tessian protects every business’s mission by securing the human layer
 
 
 
   The Tessian Cloud Email Security platform helps enterprises defend against email attacks, protect against data loss and respond to security incidents more efficiently. By combining artificial intelligence with an understanding of employee email behavior, Tessian is able to prevent complex email attacks and data loss incidents that evade Secure Email Gateways and the built in security controls of M365 and Google Workspace.
 
 
 
   The world's largest banks, healthcare organizations, hedge funds and law firms all use Tessian to secure their email environments, data and people whilst saving their security team time. In 2022 alone, Tessian prevented hundreds of thousands of business email compromise attacks, data loss incidents and saved hundreds of hours of work for security teams.
 
 
 
   Tessian is headquartered in London and Boston with 200+ employees globally and has raised over $120m in venture capital funding from world leading investors like Sequoia, Accel, Balderton, March, Citi and Okta. Tessian was recognized as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022. More information can be found at www.tessian.com.
 
 
 
   Data Science at Tessian
 
 
 
   Our mission is to secure the human layer. This involves deploying near real-time machine learning models at massive scale to some of the world’s largest organisations to keep their most sensitive data private and secure. To do this, we're looking for a senior data scientist with NLP experience ready to work on hard problems, drive best practice and cultivate an environment of experimentation and learning.
 
 
 
   Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories:
 
 
   1) You work for a business function analysing & reporting on how to improve a key metric, e.g increasing user conversion
 
 
   2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce
 
 
   3) You build the product - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist
 
 
 
   The Data Science team built the product at Tessian. We couldn't exist without our machine learning models; they are at the heart of what we do, and they are what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're searching for a Senior Data Scientist who is excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models.
  
 On a day to day basis you'll get to
 
   Work across massive enterprise email datasets
   Train and deploy models to production that impacts directly our customers and products
   Improve our ML workflow
   Work closely with our Engineering and Product Team to enhance our products.
   Make your mark on ambitious projects 
 
 We'd love to meet someone who
 
   4+ years Data Science experience
   Can balance longer term projects alongside impactful quick wins
   Cares deeply about the impact their team has
   Is creative at heart, and can encourage novel ways of thinking in their team. This has always been a core part of the data science team’s DNA
   Reads Rules of Machine Learning - Martin Zinkevich and it resonates with how they think about machine learning and data science
   Enjoys “getting their hands dirty” by digging into complex operations
   Takes responsibility for delivering large projects that require collaboration from start to finish
   Has strong listening skills; open to input from other team members and departments
   Has worked with, or understands the principles behind working with data at scale
 
 
   If you're not sure that you exactly fit all of the above criteria, please do get in touch anyway. We're always willing to speak to great candidates even if you don't feel you meet every criteria listed!
   
 
 
  
 
  Tessian is an equal opportunity employer, committed to equality and diversity amongst both our employees and prospective applicants. The Human Layer we're securing is diverse, and we know we need to be diverse and inclusive to successfully create HLS that reflects this. You can read our equality and diversity statement here.
 
 
 
   As part of our commitment to equality and diversity, we're also a corporate member of the WISE Campaign for gender equality in STEM & we're a founding member of the WEDS network driving diversity & inclusion in startups.

           About us
         
         
         
           
          As Great Britain’s electricity system operator (ESO), we sit at the heart of the electricity system, using our outstanding engineering and commercial expertise to balance electricity supply and demand. Ultimately, we keep the electricity flowing directly to where it’s needed, second by second.
           
           
          Becoming the Energy Future System Operator
           
           
          
          As you may have seen the Government and Ofgem have asked the ESO to take on new roles and responsibilities to help deliver net-zero.
           
          
          Becoming the Energy Future System Operator is a critical step to help deliver a reliable and clean energy transition for all. The ESO, including all of its existing roles, will be at the heart of the new Future System Operator, taking on additional roles with a whole energy system mindset to drive progress towards net zero while maintaining energy security and minimising costs for consumers.
           
          
          The new organisation will be set up as a public corporation with operational independence from government – bringing parties together to support optimised decision making and action. As now, it will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem but funded by consumers through price control agreements. It is anticipated that the new organisation will be up and running by or in 2024.
           
           
          The time to act on climate change is now. As part of our team, you won’t just be touching the lives of almost everyone in Great Britain – you’ll be shaping the way we use and consume energy for generations to come.
           
           
         
        
        
         
           More information
         
         
         
           
          This role closes on August 23rd at 23:59, however we encourage candidates to submit their application as early as possible and not wait until the published closing date as this can vary.
           
          
          We work towards the highest standards in everything we do, including how we support, value and develop our people. Our aim is to encourage and support employees to thrive and be the best they can be. We celebrate the difference people can bring into our organisation, and welcome and encourage applicants with diverse experiences and backgrounds, and offer flexible and tailored support, at home and in the office. 
          We're committed to building a workforce that represents the communities we serve, and a working environment in which each individual feels valued, respected, fairly treated, and able to reach their full potential.

  Conventionally, numerical modelling is widely used to provide ocean forecasts. These models involve simulating the ocean climate using mathematical equations and physical models, and exploit complex input data arising from various sources, such as satellites, in-situ measurements, and re-analysis models. However, these models are computationally expensive and time consuming to run, especially for long-term forecasts. In this Centre for Doctoral Training, we propose to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for efficient ocean climate forecast. We will examine physics informed machine learning (PIML) as a means of opening the ‘black box’ behind the AI system. This will be achieved by encoding the differential equations which govern the ocean climate into the learning algorithms, amplifying the value of the training data and optimising the exploration of the model space for improved efficiency. Furthermore the fusion of multi-modal training data from both high and low fidelity sources will be explored, facilitating predictions even in the scenarios where data is sparse.
   
   
 
 
 
  To apply, candidates should send their CV and cover letter to katy.tant@strath.ac.uk.

    The University welcomes applications for applied electronics research engineers within the School of Engineering. The post has become available due to recent extension of the precision agriculture activities in the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering over three interrelated topic areas covering intelligent sensor systems research for delivering next generation crops and arable farming technologies. More than one appointment may be possible.
     Working in partnership with industrial as well as academic researchers from other institutions and universities, you will become part of a multidisciplinary team notably in collaboration with plant scientist, materials engineers and business development researchers.
     Applications are particularly welcomed from individuals who have interests in a longer-term academic career in intelligent sensor systems for precision agriculture and bio-electronics. Support will be provided to such applicants in their downstream application to Fellowship schemes or obtaining any further qualifications, such as chartered engineering status or a higher degree (if appropriate), as part of their pursuit of the research project goals.
     The specific applied research areas to be addressed from the outset of the tenure encompass the sensor engineering associated with three principal areas:
    
     
      
        Network sensor systems for in-field imaging and data processing of crop pathogen activity (disease vectors).
        Active imaging sensors for manipulation and investigating plant photosynthesis and crop health.
        High throughput real-time detection of crop phenotypes (features) above and below the soil or other growing media
      
    
     It is not expected that you will have expertise in crop related topics, as you will be supported by colleagues with such competencies, however, previous interests in the area would be of value. As the research activity is highly applied, you will have the opportunity to contribute and be co-author on any intellectual property arising. In addition, it is anticipated the projects that are worked upon will be highly compatible with generating formal academic impact cases, alongside any publications arising, and you will be encouraged to assist and lead-on aspects of both. As the work in the group covers a breadth of precision agricultural activities in both developed and emerging economies it is anticipated that opportunities will arise throughout the research for travel and placements across the UK, Europe and further afield, notably Sub-Saharan Africa.
     Alongside the specific research deliverables you will be encouraged to develop your own related research interests and possible broader pathways to delivering impact. In particular it is anticipated that any role you have in assisting in the formulation and design of any new related successful research proposals will be formally acknowledge, within the constraints of UKRI or other funding body’s rules, through appropriate extension and broadening of the job role.
   
    As an equal opportunities employer we welcome applicants from all sections of the community regardless of age, sex, gender (or gender identity), ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and transgender status. All appointments are made on merit.

 About Actica 
  Actica is a fast-growing Digital Transformation consultancy working primarily in the UK Public Sector. We deliver high-quality, high-impact, independent, client-side advisory services to customers including MoD, Home Office, Ministry of Justice, Blue Light, National Security and other government agencies. Our diverse team of highly skilled and experienced consultants deliver complex projects to limited timescales, providing a varied range of services including business consultancy, enterprise architecture, cyber security consultancy, technology consultancy, data analytics/data science, strategic planning and procurement support. 
  Role Profile 
  As a Data Analyst or Data Scientist at Actica, you will have the opportunity to use and develop your data skills to unlock business problems for a wide range of high-profile UK public sector organisations. Your help will enable them to get the maximum benefit from their investments in technology, information and facilities, and in doing so, play a key role in nationally critical projects which make a real difference to people’s everyday lives. 
  Actica recognises that Data Analytics and Data Science are different disciplines, though closely related. When we talk about Data Analytics, we think primarily of exploiting existing data to generate deeper insights and support faster, more assured decision-taking. When we talk about Data Science, our focus is on scoping, designing, and developing innovative ways to capture and exploit new or previously unexploited data. Actica colleagues tend to move between the two, depending on experience, interest, and client requirements. In either role, you would be expected to translate business problems into data queries, applying data standards and principles to add fresh understanding. You should be able to provide advice on how best to set up data exploitation to assure success, including consideration of a range of different languages and toolsets. You will need to relate your work to the clients’ wider data environment, so understanding of some of the key principles of data architecture is also important. 
  This role will require you to work flexibly as part of teams of varying sizes and compositions – including data specialists and others with different skillsets. Over time, you may move on to leading assignments and take responsibility for supervising direct reports whilst ensuring the overall success of the engagement. 
  Our work is often ‘client-side’, working alongside and integrated closely with client staff. This means that your role will involve significant stakeholder engagement, dealing directly with the client, including in resolving day-day issues involved in assignment delivery, so strong interpersonal and influencing skills are very useful. 
  While Guildford is our home base, consultants typically spend their time working remotely. For most clients, consultants spend 2-3 days working remotely and 2-3 days co-located with colleagues at a client’s site or our office in Guildford. For some projects, there will a requirement to work up to 5 days a week co-located with colleagues. All work is team based, with a high level of engagement with other Actica and client team members. Consultants are encouraged to get involved in internal activities and to attend company team events whenever possible. 
  Career Development 
  You will be given the opportunity to further your career in data, specialising in the application of a broad range of methodologies and technical specialisations to a wide range of business problems. 
  You will have a performance and development manager, who will hold six monthly reviews (while at Consultant and Senior Consultant grades) of your progress, aspirations, objectives and training needs. In addition, a career mentor independent of your line management, will provide support and guidance throughout your journey with Actica. 
  We provide substantial training, tailored to the individual. This includes online, classroom and in-house courses, leading to nationally recognised qualifications in relation to specialisms such as Programme and Project Management; Business Change / Transformation; Agile Delivery and Procurement; Security Assurance; Governance, and; Technology Procurement. We provide structured career development pathways to help you gain responsibility and influence. 
  Responsibilities 
  Working either individually or – more usually – as part of a larger team, you will undertake assignments such as: 
  
  
   
    
     
      Creating genuinely useful data outcomes to help deliver client goals in major business transformation programmes; 
      Hands-on analytics, including working with clients, users and other team members to address data availability and quality issues before they become blockers; 
      Carrying out ‘pre-discovery’ to establish which business problems, or which parts of business problems, are best addressed through data analytics / data science; 
      Translating business problems into data exploitation queries; 
      Specifying data analytics and data science environments; 
      Understanding data flows, i.e., which parts of the organization generate data, which require data to function, how data flows are managed, and how data changes in transition; 
      Collaborating and coordinating with multiple departments, stakeholders, partners, and external vendors. 
      
    
   
  
 
 Qualifications and Experience 
  We work predominantly within the UK Defence and Public Sectors so experience within those sectors is desirable, preferably in roles which have used data to solve business problems. The fast-moving nature of the Public Sector technology environment, together with the need to resource multiple, ad-hoc assignments, also requires our data analysts and data scientists to be quick thinkers, proactive and self-motivated – with the ability to apply a structured approach to often unfamiliar subject matter. 
  The following attributes and areas of experience will make you particularly suited to this role: 
  
  
   
    
     
      Coding eg expertise in Python or R; 
      Collaborative, team-based development; 
      Cloud analytics platforms eg relevant AWS and Azure platform services; 
      Data visualisation tools eg Power BI, Qlik Sense; 
      Data science approaches and tooling eg Hadoop, Spark; 
      Data engineering approaches; 
      Database management, eg MySQL, Postgres; 
      Government Digital Service approaches, ie the Government Service Design Manual and the Service Standard; 
      Software development methods and techniques eg Agile methods such as SCRUM; 
      Software change management, notably familiarity with git; 
      Public sector best practice guidance, eg ITIL, OGC toolkit. 
      
    
   
  
 
 You will also need to hold or be eligible to hold UK security clearance; more information about the clearances can be found here: United Kingdom Security Vetting: clearance levels – GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)

 The Company 
  This highly successful strategy consultancy specialise in the government and defence sectors. 
  They have significant innovation funding from the MoD, meaning that they don't just pitch an idea to improve what's in place but actually have to prove that something has never been done before and is genuinely different to anything or anyone else. 
  The Role 
  Your role would be to develop and design decision aid tools and models to carry out analysis for customers and more recently, there has been an increased focus on product development. The content of decision aids, used for strategic or operational decision making, is predominantly AI based machine learning and there are a range of unique techniques developed internally. 
  A niche but exciting area they work in is explainable AI, which is a part of past, current projects and future plans. Given that clients are typically within the defence sector, when machine learning algorithms spit out an answer, it's not possible to simply rely on the computer saying this is what you should do. It's essential to add reasons why, which is challenging to generate from standard ML algorithms. 
  The Individual 
  
  Three years' or more of experience in data science. 
  Strong Python proficiency. 
  Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written. 
  To acquire security clearance, it's a necessity that you have lived in the UK for five consecutive years without spending more than three consecutive months out of the UK.

        Are you an applied statistician with an interest and passion for providing high-quality statistical training to agricultural and environmental scientists? We are seeking a motivated individual with good communication skills and training experience to join the Statistics and Data Science team at Rothamsted Research. You will be joining a team providing statistical expertise across a wide range of application areas in a dynamic highly interdisciplinary environment. The team contributes statistical expertise in three different ways - through training courses, as a consultancy service providing guidance to individual researchers, and through inputs to collaborative research projects.
        
        
       
        The institute has a well-established statistics training programme, focussed on providing PhD students and postdocs with the statistical knowledge they need to interact effectively with our statistical consultants. You will initially be working alongside the current Statistical Training Programme manager, as part of a succession planning strategy. After familiarising yourself with our existing training courses you will be involved in delivering these courses, taking on responsibility for leading a number of courses. You will also identify new training opportunities, working with the other data science groups (Bioinformatics; Research Data and Systems) within the institute, to build data science expertise. Alongside these training activities you will provide statistics and data science consultancy support to a range of research groups within the institute, with a particular focus on supporting PhD students. Some consultancy activities will lead to opportunities to develop collaborative research projects requiring more in-depth statistical inputs.
        
        
       
        The successful candidate will have:
        
       
        experience of applying statistical and data science methods to real biological data in a research context 
        a broad knowledge of a range of relevant statistical methods, including for the design and analysis of experiments, statistical modelling approaches and multivariate analysis methods 
        experience of teaching statistical and data science methods to biological scientists 
        an ability to communicate statistical and data science concepts to non-statisticians 
        good general computing skills including good knowledge of one or more statistical software packages/environments (preferably including Genstat or R) 
       
       
        If you are a motivated and skilled applied statistician, with good communication skills and and an interest in training and supporting agricultural and environmental researchers, we invite you to join our team. Help us to continue the strong tradition at Rothamsted Research for high-quality statistical inputs across the whole of our research programme.
        
        
       
        Interested, but not sure that you meet all of the criteria? At Rothamsted we are committed to building diverse teams, so please apply even if your past experience doesn't align perfectly with the requirements - you just might be the perfect fit!
        
        
        
        
         This is a fixed-term appointment to the end of March 2025 in the first instance, but with an expectation of continued funding after that date. Salary is in the range of either Band D £29,842-£32,315 (dependent on skills and experience). For any enquiries, please contact [email protected].

        Established in 1843, Rothamsted Research is one of the UK's leading Research Institutes delivering world class agricultural science. Our commitment to learning and development, equality and diversity as well as creating a positive work life balance, enable a welcoming environment for all prospective employees.

Posted 30+ days ago","
 Location : London 
 G-Research is Europe’s leading quantitative finance research firm. We hire the brightest minds in the world to tackle some of the biggest questions in finance. We pair this expertise with machine learning, big data, and some of the most advanced technology available to predict movements in financial markets. 
  
 The role 
  
 Machine Learning is an integral part of G-Research’s work. We use applied ML techniques to develop successful investment management strategies; it is one of the core drivers of our overall performance and success. ML has long been a key tool at G-Research and we count among our number a range of ICML and NeurIPS published researchers. 
  
 Joining our leading ML team, you will have huge amounts of (clean) data and massive compute at your fingertips, with which you will predict the future of financial markets. Because this is a very mature prediction problem, finding the 1% of difference, working at the very cutting edge of developments, is the place where success happens. You will, in effect, be incentivised to explore the state-of-the-art. 
  
 While we start with the standard ML toolkit, to make a model work our researchers really need to understand what’s going on, not just throw an out-of-the-box solution at a dataset. This involves applying machine learning methods drawn from diverse areas such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, deep learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP and approximate inference. Unlike pure problems, our researchers get near-instantaneous feedback on their work in the form of absolute numbers: success is highly measurable and has direct impact on the business. 
  
 As a team, we read the latest publications in the field and discuss them within the firm’s vibrant research community and attend the leading conferences worldwide (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ACL etc.). 
  
 In this research role you will be able to develop and test your ideas with real-world data in an environment that resembles academia. 
  
 Who are we looking for? 
  
 The ideal candidate will at a minimum have experience in the following areas: 
 
   Either a post-graduate degree in machine learning or a related discipline, or commercial experience developing novel machine learning algorithms. We will also consider exceptional candidates with a proven record of success in online data science competitions (e.g. Kaggle).
   Experience in one or more of deep learning, reinforcement learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP or approximate inference.
   Excellent reasoning skills and mathematical ability are crucial: off the shelf methods don’t always work on our data so you will need to understand how to develop your own models.
   Strong programming skills and experience working with Python, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks is desirable. Experience with object oriented programming would be beneficial.
   Publications at top conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR etc. is highly desirable.
  
  
 Why should you apply? 
 
   Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus
   Lunch provided (via Just Eat for Business) and dedicated barista bar
   30 days’ annual leave
   9% company pension contributions
   Informal dress code and excellent work/life balance
   Comprehensive healthcare and life assurance
   Cycle-to-work scheme
   Monthly company events
  
 G-Research is committed to cultivating and preserving an inclusive work environment. We are an ideas-driven business and we place great value on diversity of experience and opinions. 
 We want to ensure that applicants receive a recruitment experience that enables them to perform at their best. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation please let us know in the relevant section.

  Job Title: AI/Machine Learning Developer (contract)
  Are you an innovative and skilled developer with a passion for integrating cutting-edge technologies into web applications? We have an exciting opportunity for an AI/Machine Learning Developer to join our team for a 6-month contract, with a competitive rate of £400-£600 per day (outside IR35). This role is fully remote, allowing you to work from the comfort of your own location.  Key Responsibilities:  As an AI/Machine Learning Developer, your primary responsibility will be to develop proof of concept integrations into our web application. The key conceptual tasks include:
 
   Integrating ChatGPT with web crawlers, such as AutoGPT, to retrieve relevant information and news related to specified keywords.
   Extracting key terms from a given dataset, utilizing either the ChatGPT API or other suitable tools.
   Summarizing the output of conversational transcriptions, leveraging the ChatGPT API or alternative solutions.
   Ensuring the integration remains agnostic to the LLM (Language Model) to allow for potential swapping to other models like Bard.
   Integrating seamlessly with cloud AI transcription services (e.g., from AWS) to facilitate smooth record, stream, and transcribe operations. There is also an option for a contractor specifically dedicated to this piece, with the ultimate goal of integrating it into the existing application.
 
  The successful candidate will be required to expose these integrations as APIs, as they are intended for incorporation into a broader application framework. As the core application is built in PHP/Laravel, developers with expertise in either PHP/Laravel or Python would be well-suited for this role. The primary focus, however, is on your ability to work with LLMs (Language Models) and develop prototypes that seamlessly integrate with these and related technologies. Python skills could be advantageous, particularly given the usage of various data tools, and the fact that AutoGPT is typically implemented in Python.
  Requirements:
 
   Demonstrable experience in web application development and integration, with a strong grasp of either PHP/Laravel or Python.
   Proficiency in working with Language Models, preferably including experience with GPT-3 or similar technologies.
   Proven ability to develop and implement APIs for seamless integration with web applications.
   Familiarity with cloud AI transcription services, such as AWS, would be advantageous.
 
  If you are a motivated and proactive developer seeking to make significant contributions to a dynamic project, we encourage you to apply.  How to Apply:  To apply for this exciting opportunity, please submit your updated CV. Please include any relevant links or documentation showcasing your previous work with Language Models or similar integrations.

  About us: 
  We're here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque. 
  We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves. 
  We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo. 
  About our Financial Crime Team: 
  We're excited to be looking for a Senior Data Scientist in Financial Crime to help build the bank of the future. You'll have the opportunity to work as a part of the Financial Crime Data Science team and play a critical role in Monzo's mission to make money work for everyone. 
  What you'll be working on 
  As a Data Scientist, you'll be working in an ever changing environment where we are building and iterating on our financial crime defence capabilities to ensure we keep Monzo and our customers safe. As a financial crime team we have a large impact on Monzo's bottom line as fraud and scams are usually some of the largest cost line items in a bank's P&L. In addition, we have a great influence on the overall customer experience and it's our duty to keep them safe. Most of the work we do results in directly measurable customer or company benefit which is incredibly satisfying. 
  Our Data Scientists don't have a permanent assignment to a problem space and might rotate into different financial crime areas after some time. The major problem spaces that we are working in are: fraud prevention, transaction monitoring for different types of suspicious activity, customer risk assessment and operational tooling to name the biggest ones. At the moment we are about 21 people in financial crime data, including Analytics Engineers, Data Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists. 
  As part of your job you'll work closely with product managers, engineers, designers and researchers in an agile product environment. You'll champion the use of data, bring ideas to life through rigorous experimentation and A/B testing. You'll help us get the most out of large volumes of data stored on a modern cloud native data platform and with spotting opportunities to make each area of financial crime work even better for our users and for Monzo. 
  Our culture is open and focused on collaboration between different functions and individuals. It is fast paced and innovative where we try to push the boundaries of the current financial industry best practices. We put a lot of emphasis on feedback (up, side and downwards) and personal growth and development. 
  Your day-to-day 
 
  Develop and drive data solutions that improve our ability to fight financial crime and keep customers safe 
  Conduct deep dives into various Fincrime systems for fraud detection, transaction monitoring and customer risk to identify key business opportunities 
  Work closely with financial crime analysts, operations analysts, data scientists and engineers to understand the underlying business problem and propose an appropriate solution 
  Translate regulatory reporting requirements into highly accurate data models and set the strategy for how we ensure the best possible data accuracy 
  Build robust data models, reports and visualisations downstream of backend services (mostly in BigQuery SQL) that support internal management information as well as governance and regulatory reporting 
  Investigate and effectively work with colleagues from other disciplines to address and improve data quality 
 
 You should apply if: 
 
  Reducing financial crime and protecting customers with data driven strategies sounds fun to you 
  You have multiple years of analytics experience, preferably in a fast moving tech company or consultancy 
  You are comfortable exploring potentially ambiguous business problems and enjoy finding technical solutions to them 
  You're as comfortable getting hands-on as well as taking a step back and thinking strategically and proactively identifying opportunities 
  You have experience working together and collaborating with senior business stakeholders and product teams 
  You're familiar with using a variety of Data Science tools (from business intelligence, experimentation and causal inference through to machine learning), and coding languages (SQL and Python). You know when to pick the right tool, and can help others do the same 
 
 The Interview Process: 
  Our interview process involves three main stages: 
  
  
   Initial Call
   
  
   Take home task or pair coding exercise
   
  
   Final interview including a system design and a behavioural interview
   
  
 Our average process takes around 2-3 weeks but we will always work around your availability. 
  You will have the chance to speak to our recruitment team at various points during your process but if you 
  do have any specific questions or want to talk through reasonable adjustments ahead of or during application please us at any point on tech-hiring@monzo.com 
  What's in it for you: 
  ✈️ We can help you relocate to the UK 
  ✅ We can sponsor visas 
  This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working within the UK (with ad hoc meetings in London). 
 
  We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
  
  Learning budget of £1,000 a year for books, training courses and conferences 
  ➕And much more, see our full list of benefits here 
  If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance. 
  
 Equal Opportunity Statement 
  We are actively creating an equitable environment for every Monzonaut to thrive. 
  Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us.

  Tessian protects every business’s mission by securing the human layer
 
 
 
   The Tessian Cloud Email Security platform helps enterprises defend against email attacks, protect against data loss and respond to security incidents more efficiently. By combining artificial intelligence with an understanding of employee email behavior, Tessian is able to prevent complex email attacks and data loss incidents that evade Secure Email Gateways and the built in security controls of M365 and Google Workspace.
 
 
 
   The world's largest banks, healthcare organizations, hedge funds and law firms all use Tessian to secure their email environments, data and people whilst saving their security team time. In 2022 alone, Tessian prevented hundreds of thousands of business email compromise attacks, data loss incidents and saved hundreds of hours of work for security teams.
 
 
 
   Tessian is headquartered in London and Boston with 200+ employees globally and has raised over $120m in venture capital funding from world leading investors like Sequoia, Accel, Balderton, March, Citi and Okta. Tessian was recognized as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022. More information can be found at www.tessian.com.
 
 
 
   Data Science at Tessian
 
 
 
   Our mission is to secure the human layer. This involves deploying near real-time machine learning models at massive scale to some of the world’s largest organisations to keep their most sensitive data private and secure. To do this, we're looking for a senior data scientist with NLP experience ready to work on hard problems, drive best practice and cultivate an environment of experimentation and learning.
 
 
 
   Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories:
 
 
   1) You work for a business function analysing & reporting on how to improve a key metric, e.g increasing user conversion
 
 
   2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce
 
 
   3) You build the product - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist
 
 
 
   The Data Science team built the product at Tessian. We couldn't exist without our machine learning models; they are at the heart of what we do, and they are what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're searching for a Senior Data Scientist who is excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models.
  
 On a day to day basis you'll get to
 
   Work across massive enterprise email datasets
   Train and deploy models to production that impacts directly our customers and products
   Improve our ML workflow
   Work closely with our Engineering and Product Team to enhance our products.
   Make your mark on ambitious projects 
 
 We'd love to meet someone who
 
   4+ years Data Science experience
   Can balance longer term projects alongside impactful quick wins
   Cares deeply about the impact their team has
   Is creative at heart, and can encourage novel ways of thinking in their team. This has always been a core part of the data science team’s DNA
   Reads Rules of Machine Learning - Martin Zinkevich and it resonates with how they think about machine learning and data science
   Enjoys “getting their hands dirty” by digging into complex operations
   Takes responsibility for delivering large projects that require collaboration from start to finish
   Has strong listening skills; open to input from other team members and departments
   Has worked with, or understands the principles behind working with data at scale
 
 
   If you're not sure that you exactly fit all of the above criteria, please do get in touch anyway. We're always willing to speak to great candidates even if you don't feel you meet every criteria listed!
   
 
 
  
 
  Tessian is an equal opportunity employer, committed to equality and diversity amongst both our employees and prospective applicants. The Human Layer we're securing is diverse, and we know we need to be diverse and inclusive to successfully create HLS that reflects this. You can read our equality and diversity statement here.
 
 
 
   As part of our commitment to equality and diversity, we're also a corporate member of the WISE Campaign for gender equality in STEM & we're a founding member of the WEDS network driving diversity & inclusion in startups.

 About Pangaea Data Limited 
 Pangaea Data provides a novel AI driven product, which has clinically proven to characterize patients in a federated privacy preserving and scalable manner. For example, Pangaea helped characterize cachexia in cancer patients, which led to the discovery of 6x more undiagnosed, miscoded and at risk cachectic cancer patients with 95% accuracy with the potential to save £1billion annually and improving outcomes. Additionally, US based healthcare systems have applied Pangaea to measure health inequity across the US through characterization of patients and their journeys based on tumour genomic testing results, demographics and social indicators from patient records. Clinicians at pharmaceutical companies are applying Pangaea to discover new clinically actionable insights which have helped them find new drug targets, define new end points for clinical trials, understand relationships between drugs and adverse events, find more patients for clinical trials and during the launch of new therapies.

   Today, we work towards our mission to empower businesses to thrive in the Experience Economy by creating the tools and technology that turn transactions into meaningful relationships. For our business customers, that means fast funding, the fastest payments, smart integrations, and efficient virtual queues & bookings - all with instant insight across the board.

   Our way of working
 
 
 
   Dojo has adopted a set of shared principles with the aim of increasing in-person collaboration and amplifying our ‘Customer First’ values.

 The Department of Chemical Engineering invites applications by highly talented researchers for a Postdoctoral Research Associate position in Machine Learning of Nonequilibrium Processes as part of the ERC Advanced Grand “Machine-Aided General Framework for Fluctuating Dynamic Density Functional Theory (MAGFFDDFT)”.
  
  
  The overarching objective is the development of a generic theoretical-numerical framework aided by machine learning that would allow us to obtain rationally and systematically optimal low-dimensional general laws governing the dynamics of observables, which in turn can be used for the accurate and efficient analysis of classical fluids, and complex multiscale systems (CMS) in general, far from equilibrium conditions.
  
  
  Your work will be primarily computational focusing on physics-informed machine learning (ML), in particular coupling the parallel theoretical developments in the project with ML.
  
  
  In the long term, the framework could potentially shift the paradigm in a number of fields, while targeted applications will ultimately establish it as a useful and versatile toolbox for the mathematical and computational scrutiny of CMS. 
 Duties and responsibilities 
 You will lead the main project theme:
  
  
  Deep learning from molecular dynamics (MD) and optimal FDDFT model for non-equilibrium: use MD data and deep neural networks to machine learn the terms, which are impossible to track down analytically, of the FDDFT model derived in the parallel theoretical efforts.
  
  
  You will also disseminate the research findings with peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and you will assist the other researchers in the Group and the Principal Investigators. 
 Essential requirements 
 You should have (or about to receive) a PhD in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Computational Science & Engineering, Engineering, Physics, or other related field, and a strong foundation and proven record in scientific computing and numerical methods. Given the technical complexity of the research, you should have strong problem-solving skills.
  
  
  Experience or good knowledge with some or all of the following areas is highly desirable: numerical and applied analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs)/stochastic PDEs, stochastic processes, and physics, especially fluid dynamics and statistical physics.
  
  
  The post offers a unique opportunity to be part of a world-class research environment at Imperial College. You will join a highly interdisciplinary team working on a wide variety of exciting projects at the interface between applied mathematics and engineering science fundamentals.
  
  
 
  Candidates who have not yet been officially awarded their PhD will be appointed as Research Assistant within the salary range £40,694 – £43,888 per annum.
  
 Further information 
 You can start immediately and ideally no later than 01/09/2023. The position is available for 24 months in the first instance, with the possibility of extension subject to research funding. The post is based in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London (South Kensington Campus).
  
  
  Informal enquiries about the post can be made to Professor Serafim Kalliadasis (s.kalliadasis@impeial.ac.uk) or Dr. Miguel A. Durán-Olivencia (m.duran-olivencia@imperial.ac.uk).

 London/Anywhere (UK) + Benefits | 
  About us: 
  We're here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque. 
  We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves. 
  We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo. 
  About our Machine Learning, Financial Crime Team: 
  As a Machine Learning Scientist, you'll be working in an ever changing environment where we are building and iterating on our financial crime defence capabilities to ensure we keep Monzo and our customers safe. As a financial crime team we have a large impact on Monzo's bottom line as fraud and scams are usually some of the largest cost line items in a bank's P&L. In addition, we have a great influence on the overall customer experience and it's our duty to keep them safe. Most of the work we do results in directly measurable customer or company benefit which is incredibly satisfying. 
  Our Machine Learning Scientists don't have a permanent assignment to a problem space and might rotate into different financial crime areas after some time. The major problem spaces that we are working in are: fraud detection and prevention, transaction monitoring for different types of suspicious activity, customer risk assessment and operational tooling to name the biggest ones. At the moment we are about 21 people in financial crime data, including Analytics Engineers, Data Analysts, Machine Learning Scientist and Data Scientists. 
  What you'll be working on:  As part of your job you'll work closely with product managers, data scientists, backend engineers, designers and researchers in an agile product environment. You'll champion the use of data and machine learning techniques, bring ideas to life through rigorous experimentation and A/B testing. 
  As a technical Machine Learning expert, working with large volumes of data stored on a modern cloud native data platform, we'll be expecting you to leverage your skills and experience to help us to develop, deploy and maintain advanced Machine Learning solutions that enable us to: 
  
  Quickly detect emerging trends in fraud and financial crime 
  Automatically and accurately detect suspicious customer behaviours 
  Adapt quickly and appropriately to changes in customer and fraudster behaviours, ensuring our detection systems remain performant through time. 
  
 The technical approaches you take to help solve these problems will be very much in your hands and we'll strongly encourage and support experimentation and innovation. We'll be expecting you to justify and demonstrate effectiveness along the way, making sure the approach meets our business and customer needs. 
  Our culture is open and focused on collaboration between different functions and individuals. It is fast paced and innovative where we try to push the boundaries of the current financial industry best practices. We put a lot of emphasis on feedback (up, side and downwards) and personal growth and development. 
  Your day-to-day 
  You'll be a member of the machine learning discipline, working within a product squad in financial crime to help to design, build, analyse, and experiment with machine learning systems that make use of the data we gather. 
  We organise our machine learning projects into three distinct phases; you'll spend your time doing all three: 
  
  Explore. We use BigQuery and Jupyter Notebooks to analyse data and design machine learning models for offline evaluation. For example, we are investigating machine learning powered assistants for our customer operations team, classifiers to detect financial fraud or to assess customer risk at signup. 
  Launch. We build Python micro services and cron jobs to put promising machine learning models into production. We are actively working on automating as much of this step as possible: our goal is for any data scientist or ML engineer to be able to deploy a promising new model to production in less than a day. 
  Iterate. We run A/B tests in partnership with other teams and analyse the results. Based on outcomes, we may decide to roll the model out to every customer or to explore improvements to the model for further testing. 
  
 You should apply if: What we're doing here at Monzo excites you! 
  
  You're impact driven and excited to own the end to end journey that starts with a business problem and ends with your solution having a measurable impact in production 
  You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so 
  Reducing financial crime and protecting customers with data driven strategies sounds exciting to you 
  You have a solid grounding in SQL and Python, are comfortable using them every day, and keen to learn Go lang which is used in many of our microservices 
  You have multiple years of experience using advanced machine learning techniques to tackle real business problems preferably in a fast moving tech company 
  You are comfortable exploring potentially ambiguous business problems within a complex and rapidly growing organisation 
  You're excited about the potential of machine learning and can communicate those ideas to colleagues who are not familiar with the domain 
  You're adaptable, curious and enjoy learning new technologies and ideas 
 
 Nice to haves: 
 
  Experience from working with financial crime and regulated institutions 
  You have commercial experience writing critical production code and working with microservices 
  Experience with representation learning techniques of sequential and/or graph data

 Summary
 
   Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.
 
 
 
   Are you passionate about machine learning systems that build high-quality, high-impact solutions for automated decision-making? Do you want to help local businesses grow and succeed? Yelp's Ads group works on challenging, multi-disciplinary problems at scale—spanning machine learning, data structures & algorithms, optimization, statistics, and distributed systems—with the goal of creating a healthy, valued marketplace between customers and advertisers.
 
 
 
   As a Senior Software Engineer (Machine Learning) within the Ads group, you’ll be joining a team that focuses on dynamically optimizing the allocation of ad campaign budgets across multiple channels.
 
 
 
   This opportunity requires you to be located in the the United Kingdom. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don't feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
 
  What you'll do:
 
   Productionize machine learning, statistical, and optimization model-based features developed by applied and data scientists.
   Develop and maintain reliable, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
   Partner with our ML platform team to ensure your team and group leverage Yelp's ML tools effectively and in accordance with best practices.
   Help shape the future of ML at Yelp by providing valuable feedback and contributing to tool improvements.
   Independently manage and lead software development projects.
   Act as a bridge between applied and data scientists (who may not have experience building scalable systems) and generalist backend engineers (who may lack experience with ML or other mathematical/statistical model-based systems).
 
  What it takes to succeed:
 
   Several years of experience productionizing machine learning, statistical, or optimization model-based features, ideally at a scale that is comparable to Yelp's.
   Expertise in Python (including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost), with experience in Spark, cloud (AWS), and microservices (Docker, Kubernetes).
   Sufficient knowledge of machine learning and modeling to understand the work of the applied scientists, but not expected to have deep theoretical knowledge.
   Ability to thrive in a fast-paced and high-impact environment.
 
  What you'll get:
 
   Full responsibility for projects from day one, a collaborative team, and a dynamic work environment.
   Competitive salary with equity in the company, a pension scheme, and an optional employee stock purchase plan.
   25 days paid holiday (rising to 29 with service), plus one floating holiday.
   £150 monthly reimbursement to help cover remote working expenses.
   £75 caregiver reimbursement to support dependent care for families.
   Private health insurance, including dental and vision.
   Flexible working hours and meeting-free Wednesdays.
   Regular 3-day Hackathons, bi-weekly learning groups, and productivity spending to support and encourage your career growth.
   Opportunities to participate in digital events and conferences.
   £56 per month to use toward qualifying wellness expenses.
   Quarterly team offsites.
 
 
  Closing
 
   Yelp values diversity. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and consider qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, medical condition, disability, or any other protected status.

 About Pangaea Data Limited 
 Pangaea Data provides a novel AI-driven product, which has clinically proven to characterize patients in a privacy-preserving and scalable manner.

 About us 
 UCL is one of the world’s top universities. Based in the heart of London, it is a modern, outward looking institution. At its establishment in 1826, UCL was radical and responsive to the needs of society, and this ethos – that excellence should go hand-in-hand with enriching society – continues today. UCL’s excellence extends across all academic disciplines; from one of Europe’s largest and most productive hubs for biomedical science interacting with several leading London hospitals, to world-renowned centres for architecture (UCL Bartlett) and fine art (UCL Slade School). UCL is in practice a university in its own right, although constitutionally a college within the federal University of London. With an annual turnover exceeding £800 million, it is financially and managerially independent of the University of London. The Department of Mathematics at UCL is an internationally renowned department within one of the world’s most prestigious universities. Since its beginning, mathematics at UCL has been enhanced by its many outstanding members of staff. Indeed, two of its students (and later staff) Professor Klaus Roth (1958) and Professor Alan Baker (1970) have gone on to win the Fields Medal. Another former member of staff Professor Tim Gowers won the Fields Medal in 1998 for work he did whilst at UCL. Since 2011 the department has grown with academic staff increasing by 25%. We also welcome a regular stream of distinguished visiting academics from home and abroad. The broad range of research interests is reflected in the large choice of courses available in the third and fourth years of the degree programmes, from spectral theory, groups and geometry to fluid mechanics and from mathematical ideas in biology to cosmology. Research funding in the department from EPSRC, ERC, Leverhulme Trust and the Wellcome Trust has grown significantly in recent years with an increase of 70% in total funding since 2011. The Clinical Operational Research Unit (CORU) is a team within the Department of Mathematics dedicated to applying operational research, data science and mathematical modelling to problems in healthcare. To find out more, visit https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-operational-research-unit/. The CORU offices are at 4 Taviton Street on the main UCL site. 
 About the role 
 Applications are invited for a full time Research Fellow in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning for Clinical Modelling, with Dr Alex Diaz. The succesful candidate will be based in the UCL Clinical Operational Research Unit (CORU) at the Department of Mathematics, and will also be a researcher at the CHIMERA Hub. The post is available from 1st September 2023 or as soon as possible thereafter. The post is funded for 24 months. The Clinical Operational Research Unit (CORU) is a team of researchers dedicated to applying operational research and mathematical modelling approaches to problems in healthcare. One of the projects within CORU is CHIMERA, one of four EPSRC-funded Mathematical Sciences in Healthcare Hubs. CHIMERA is a multidisciplinary Hub which brings together experts in mathematics, statistics, data science and machine learning and will develop new physiology models and use them to inform clinical decision making. The responsibilities of the post will include undertaking research in computational statistics and machine learning, including (but not limited to) developing methods and algorithms such as: MCMC samplers, Gaussian processes, history matching and neural networks. These will enhance research in clinical and biophysical modelling, by applying them to Intensive Care Unit data acquired by our partner hospitals and to computational models developed within the Hub. The ideal candidate will plan and perform computational experiments and record, analyse and provide written and/or oral reports of their results. They must aim at establishing a strongly multidisciplinary research environment with collaborators in the CHIMERA Hub. Within the role, they may need to contribute to the supervision of PhD students (with the support of the CHIMERA investigator team) and write/submit papers to appropriate peer-reviewed journals, research bids and proposals.

  The Roku Culture 
   Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 
   We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

 About us 
 
 We are a collaboration between the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (a world-class research unit in both computational neuroscience and machine learning), the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour (SWC; a top experimental neuroscience research centre investigating how neural circuits produce behaviour), and NeuroGEARS Ltd (a private technology company and a research group that collaborates with research and academic institutions worldwide to develop equipment, data acquisition and control software to support cutting-edge basic and translational Neuroscience research). NeuroGEARS created Bonsai, a visual programming language that currently is used to control thousands of Neuroscience experiments around the world, and is at the centre of a vibrant and growing ecosystem of hardware and software projects in neuroscience, including Open-Ephys, DeepLabCut, Miniscope, Harp, and Neurophotometrics.
  
 About the role 
 
 With our collaborators we have recently been awarded a grant from the UK Biomedical and Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC) to extend the Bonsai visual reactive programming language with machine learning functionality and enable its users to control their experiments based on real-time inferences derived from behavioural and/or neural data.  In this exciting role you will use advanced expertise in real-time machine learning and deep knowledge of experimental and computational neuroscience to identify powerful algorithms to address important neuroscience problems, you will create Bonsai packages implementing these algorithms, and you test these packages with state-of-the-art neural and behavioural data produced at the SWC.  You will have the unique opportunity to improve your skills in computational neuroscience and machine learning by being part of the vibrant Gatsby Unit, in experimental neuroscience by interacting closely with SWC neuroscientists, in online experimental control by working with the NeuroGEARS team, and in research software by connecting with research software engineers from the Neuroinformatics Unit at the SWC building and by being an associate member of the Advanced Research Computing Centre at UCL.

   The Roku Culture 
   Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 
   We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

     Job summary
    
      The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a leader in marine science and technology, providing innovation, scientific evidence and impartial professional advice on the aquatic environment. Our work for the UK Government, national and international partners addresses the global problems of climate change, biodiversity loss and food security. The Data Science and Statistics Team collaborate with scientific experts across Cefas’ Science Directorate, providing technical expertise to deliver study design and analysis, novel data capture, input to national and international working groups, and peer-reviewed publications.
      Working in the Data Science and Statistics Team, you will have a prominent role in developing and leading Cefas data science and automated image analysis capability. The work involves identifying and addressing complex research questions, developing end-to-end applications of artificial intelligence and statistical algorithms to address priority questions in marine and freshwater science. Current projects include developing data, systems, and algorithms to automatically monitor plankton, seabed fauna, and fish catches, and remotely detect beach litter. This work will involve large, unstructured data sets, with the post-holder collaborating closely with IT colleagues to specify and deploy high performance computing and data storage infrastructure.
      The team’s remit spans Cefas’ broad science themes, so you will have opportunities to lead the analysis and modelling of fisheries and environmental datasets, and peer-reviewed publications, establishing your areas of research interest. You will also promote reproducible research, contribute to funding applications, and build external relationships, including with our strategic partners such as The Alan Turing Institute and leading UK universities.
      Cefas is proud of a diverse and inclusive work environment, committed to fairness and the promotion of equality of opportunity for all. We know that having a range of experiences, backgrounds, ways of working and thinking, makes us a stronger organisation, better at reflecting the communities we serve. We embrace different views and experiences and value the fresh perspective that people from a variety of circumstances bring to the work we do. We welcome applications from candidates who have not previously worked for the Civil Service, mid- and late-career changers with transferable skills, people from all backgrounds and circumstances regardless of disability, gender, age, ethnicity, LGBT+ identity and socio-economic status.

       Blended Working
       Using a blended working framework, we can have some choice over when, where and how we work to deliver our outcomes to meet customer and business needs.

       The remainder of the working week may be located by personal choice to best meet Cefas business need: at home, another Cefas base, field work, vessel, visiting a Defra site or other customer base.
       Reserve List
       A reserve list may be held for a period of 12 months from which further appointments can be made.
       Salary
       New entrants are expected to start on the minimum of the pay band.
       Visa Sponsorship Statement
       Please take note that Defra does not hold a UK Visa & Immigration (UKVI) Skilled Worker License sponsor and are unable to sponsor any individuals for Skilled Worker Sponsorship.
       Reasonable Adjustment
       If a person with disabilities is put at a substantial disadvantage compared to a non-disabled person, we have a duty to make reasonable changes to our processes.
       If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should:
      
        Contact Government Recruitment Service via defrarecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.
        Complete the “Assistance required” section in the “Additional requirements” page of your application form to tell us what changes or help you might need further on in the recruitment process.

       If you are experiencing accessibility problems with any attachments on this advert, please contact the email address in the 'Contact point for applicants' section.
       Criminal Record Check
       If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check may be carried out.
       In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service on your behalf. However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.
       Internal Fraud Database Check

This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.
       A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5-year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.
       Childcare Vouchers
       Any move to Defra from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk
       Feedback will only be provided if you attend an interview or assessment.

  Lead AI/ML Engineer
   
   
  Established Financial Technology
   
   
  Greenfield Project
   
   
  £120,000 - £150,000 + package
   
   A global financial services firm are embarking on a brand-new project to harness the power of the vast quantities of financial data they produce.
   
   The remit for this role is straight forward; using the enormous datasets that the firm continues to produce, explore the possibilities that AI and ML can offer.
   
   This is a well-funded project in an incredibly profitable and well-respected business with a large, global client-base. This is an opportunity for an experience ML Engineer to come in and add a whole new dimension to the business.
   
   The firm are less concerned about years of experience and background, hence the fairly wide-ranging salary on offer – what they’re interested in is the individual. Someone who can come in and grab this opportunity to make this their own and quickly demonstrate what’s possible.
   
   Previous experience of working in a financial services organisation could prove advantageous but is not a requirement.
   
   There is a large budget available for this as the firm has seen enough through opensource to believe there is a huge potential to be unlocked – if you’re the person to do it, you will soon be involved in growing a team around you, meaning excellent career development.
   
   
  For full details of this unique opportunity, please contact Ian Bailey at Harrington Starr
